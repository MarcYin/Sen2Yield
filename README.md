This repository contains the crop production monitoring with Sentinel data at 10 meter scale. The system mainly consist of three part, AC for optical measurements from Sentinel 2, biophysical parameter (LAI) retrieval from satellite images, and lastly the yield prediction with ensembles from WOFOST model using LAI as input. The system has been deployed on Google Earth Engine and it is free for public usage, and it also offers planetary-scale analysis capabilities to allow us process data over the whole North China Plain, covering an area of more than 400,000 square kilometers.
